# ASCII Dungeon Crawl
Dungeon Crawl is a simple procedural commandline ASCII dungeon delving game that gets exponentially harder the further your party traverses in the dungeon. The goal is to get as far as you can before getting defeated.

# Credits
This game is dedicated to both my 7 year old sons. I am using this simple game to teach my kids programming and game design.

> NOTE: Once a week I sit down with my boys and go over how to program. I usually introduce them to a new concept or syntax then make a new game from scratch using whatever subject we are trying to learn. In the past we've made simple games like Simon Says, Calculators, Horse Racing, etc; each with their own challenges for the boys to learn. This is the first time I wanted to push the code to a public repo for everyone to enjoy my sons creation.
